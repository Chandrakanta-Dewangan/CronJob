# CronJob
 
By default config file is included in the project. It can be opened with Android Studio and executed.

User only needs to enter the current time in stdin and the config file which is added in the package will be read and accordingly output will be shown.

If the config file path has to be entered at stdin then code is there which has comments to enable this feature. 
To do so code can be uncommented and a complete file path has to be given in the stdin when prompted to enter.
